I"<p>My name is Matt Gibson. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University Bloomington studying evolution, ecology, and informatics. I am a member of Leonie Moyle’s lab, which you can read more about <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~moylelab/">here</a>.<br /> <br />You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/gibsonmatt">Github</a> or email me at gibsomat at indiana.edu.<br /><br /> My dissertation research is focused on understanding the genetic and physiological mechanisms of <strong>adaptation</strong>, especially to abiotic climatic variation. I study this in wild relatives of domesticated tomato (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>lycopersicon</em>). <br />
<br />
I’m also interested in <strong>conservation genetics</strong> and the genomic consequences of hybridization between invasive and endemic plant taxa. I study this on the Galápagos Islands in collaboration with researchers at the Unveristy of San Francisco in Quito, Ecuador.<br /> 
<br />
Other projects I have been involved in include dissecting the genetic basis of divergent floral traits and understanding the role of <strong>pleiotropy</strong> in rapid floral diversification in <em>Jaltomata</em>, the sister genus to <em>Solanum</em>. This work was done in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/JalFlowerEvo">Jamie Kostyun</a> and was recently published in <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15844">New Phytologist</a>. <br />
<br />
With <a href="https://twitter.com/mhibbinsbiology">Mark Hibbins</a>, I am developing simulation software to predict the probability that convergent trait patterns are the result of <strong>hemiplasy</strong> rather than independent evolutionary events. You can find out more about this on our <a href="https://github.com/mhibbins/hemiplasytool">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
