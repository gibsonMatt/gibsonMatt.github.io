I"Ø<p>My name is Matt Gibson. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University Bloomington studying evolution, ecology, and informatics. I am a member of Leonie Moyleâ€™s lab, which you can read more about <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~moylelab/">here</a>.<br /> <br />You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/gibsonmatt">Github</a> or email me at gibsomat at indiana.edu.<br /><br /> My research is focused on understanding the genetic and physiological mechanisms of <strong>adaptation</strong>, especially to abiotic climatic variation, using population and quantitative genetics. I study this in wild relatives of domesticated tomato (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>lycopersicon</em>). <br />
<br />
Iâ€™m also interested in <strong>invasion genetics</strong> and the genomic consequences of hybridization between invasive and endemic plant taxa. I study this on the GalÃ¡pagos Islands in collaboration with researchers at the Unveristy of San Francisco in Quito, Ecuador.<br /></p>
