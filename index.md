My name is Matt Gibson. I am a Ph.D. candidate and computational biologist at Indiana University Bloomington studying evolution, ecology, and informatics. I am a member of Leonie Moyle's lab, which you can read more about <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~moylelab/">here</a>.<br> <br>You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/gibsonmatt">Github</a> or email me at gibsomat at indiana.edu.<br><br> My research is focused on understanding the genetic mechanisms of <strong>adaptation</strong>, especially to abiotic climatic variation, using population genetics and computing. I currently study this in wild relatives of domesticated tomato (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>lycopersicon</em>). <br>
<br>
I'm also interested in <strong>invasion genetics</strong> and the genomic consequences of hybridization between invasive and endemic plant taxa. I study this on the Gal√°pagos Islands in collaboration with researchers at the Unveristy of San Francisco in Quito, Ecuador.<br>
