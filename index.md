My name is Matt Gibson. I am a data scientist/statistical geneticist at <a href="https://gencove.com">Gencove</a>. I have a PhD in Evolutionary Genetics and Bioinformatics from Indiana University, where I worked with Leonie Moyle. <br> <br> I am interested in evolution, population genetics, and developing computational solutions to complex biological problems. I have published on many topics, including <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15477">landscape genetics</a>, <a href = "https://elifesciences.org/articles/64165">population genomics of invasive species</a>, <a href = "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63753">phylogenetic inference</a>, and <a href = "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.635990">molecular evolution</a>.
