My name is Matt Gibson. I am a senior data scientist/statistical geneticist in biotech (currently at  <a href="https://gencove.com">Gencove</a>). I have a PhD in Evolutionary Genetics and Bioinformatics from Indiana University, where I worked with Leonie Moyle. <br> <br> I am interested in evolution, population genetics, and developing computational solutions to complex biological problems. I have published on many topics, including <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15477">landscape genetics</a>, <a href = "https://elifesciences.org/articles/64165">population genomics of invasive species</a>, <a href = "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63753">phylogenetic inference</a>, <a href = "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.635990">molecular evolution</a>,  <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.10.552684v2.abstract">imputation</a>, and  <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.30.578044v1.abstract">low pass sequencing</a>.
