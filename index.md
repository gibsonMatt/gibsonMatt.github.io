My name is Matt Gibson. I am a graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington studying evolution, ecology, and informatics. I am a member of Leonie Moyle's lab, which you can read more about <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~moylelab/">here</a>.<br> <br>You can find me on <a href="http://github.com/gibsonmatt">Github</a> or email me at gibsomat at indiana.edu.<br><br> My research is focused on understanding the genetic and genomic mechanisms of adaptation, especially to abiotic climatic variation. I study this in wild relatives of domesticated tomato (<em>Solanum</em> sect. <em>lycopersicon</em>).
